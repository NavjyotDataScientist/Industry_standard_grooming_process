From an industry-standard grooming perspective, here’s my honest and constructive feedback:

What’s working well 💪

Neat appearance: Your grooming looks clean and intentional — that already puts you ahead of many candidates.

Professional vibe: The look fits well with roles in tech / data science / ML, where clean and simple is preferred.

Confidence factor: Your posture and expression give a calm, serious, “I know my work” impression.

Where you can level it up to industry-polished 🚀

Hair: A slightly sharper trim or cleaner edges (especially around sides/back) would give a more corporate-tech finish.

Beard (if present): Either keep it evenly trimmed or go clean-shaven for interviews — consistency matters.

Clothing (if this is for LinkedIn / CV photo):

Solid colors (navy, grey, white, light blue) work best

Avoid busy patterns

Lighting & background:

Natural light facing you

Plain background = instant professional upgrade

Verdict 🧠

✅ Suitable for industry
⚠️ Minor refinements can make it interview-ready & LinkedIn-perfect

If you want, next we can:

Optimize this look specifically for European companies

Decide LinkedIn vs CV vs GitHub profile photo standards

Do a TEDx-speaker grooming version (yes, that’s different 😉)
